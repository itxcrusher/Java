    // ? Names must begin with a letter
    // ? Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace
    // ? Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we should avoid that)
    // ? Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
    // ? Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names
